    "### CrewAI: A Breakdown for a Medical Doctor\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, Doctor, let's talk about CrewAI. Think of it as a way to **automate \n",
    "complex tasks by simulating a team of AI \"agents\" working together**. It's \n",
    "not a diagnostic tool, nor does it replace clinical judgment. Instead, \n",
    "it's a framework for building automated workflows, and I'll explain it in \n",
    "a way that hopefully maps to your understanding of how teams function in a \n",
    "hospital setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's the core concept:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of asking a single, large language model (like ChatGPT) to do \n",
    "everything, CrewAI lets you define **multiple AI \"agents,\" each with a \n",
    "specific role, goal, and skillset.** These agents then *collaborate* to \n",
    "achieve a larger objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of asking one doctor to both diagnose a patient, research \n",
    "treatment options, and then file the insurance claims, you'd have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A Diagnostic Agent:** Specializes in analyzing patient data and \n",
    "generating potential diagnoses.\n",
    "* **A Research Agent:** Dedicated to searching medical literature for the \n",
    "latest treatment protocols.\n",
    "* **An Administrative Agent:** Focused on handling insurance paperwork and \n",
    "billing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works (simplified):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You define the \"Crew\":** You create agents, each with:\n",
    "    * **Role:**  A description of the agent's expertise (e.g., \"Medical \n",
    "Researcher,\" \"Data Analyst,\" \"Report Writer\").\n",
    "    * **Goal:** A specific objective for that agent (e.g., \"Find the \n",
    "latest clinical trials for stage 3 melanoma\").\n",
    "    * **Tools:** Access to specific resources – this is key.  These could \n",
    "include:\n",
    "        * **Google Search:** For information retrieval.\n",
    "        * **Web Browsers:** To access websites and databases.\n",
    "        * **APIs:** To interact with other software (e.g., electronic \n",
    "health records - *this is where it gets really interesting, but also \n",
    "complex – more on that later*).\n",
    "        * **Calculators/Scripting:** For data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **You define a \"Task\":** You give the crew a larger task to accomplish \n",
    "(e.g., \"Develop a comprehensive treatment plan for a patient with a rare \n",
    "genetic disorder\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Crew Collaborates:**  CrewAI manages the communication and \n",
    "workflow between the agents. They essentially “talk” to each other, share \n",
    "information, and delegate tasks until the overall goal is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's how this could be applied (potential use cases, keeping in mind \n",
    "early stage):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Literature Reviews:** Automate the process of summarizing a large body \n",
    "of medical research on a specific topic.\n",
    "* **Clinical Trial Matching:**  Identify relevant clinical trials for \n",
    "patients based on their diagnosis and medical history.\n",
    "* **Report Generation:**  Create draft summaries of patient cases for \n",
    "presentations or consultations.\n",
    "* **Data Analysis:** Extract and analyze data from various sources (EHRs, \n",
    "research databases) to identify trends or patterns.\n",
    "* **Prior Authorization Assistance:**  Help automate the process of \n",
    "obtaining prior authorization for medications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations (especially for a medical professional):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment:** This is absolutely crucial.  \n",
    "CrewAI *assists*, it does not *replace* a doctor’s expertise.  All outputs \n",
    "*must* be reviewed and validated by a qualified healthcare professional.\n",
    "* **Data Privacy & Security:**  Working with patient data requires strict \n",
    "adherence to HIPAA and other privacy regulations. Implementing CrewAI in a \n",
    "clinical setting requires careful consideration of data security and \n",
    "access controls.\n",
    "* **Accuracy & Reliability:** LLMs are prone to \"hallucinations\" (making \n",
    "up information).  Thorough validation of all outputs is essential.\n",
    "* **Integration with EHRs (future potential):**  While currently complex, \n",
    "the real power lies in integrating CrewAI with electronic health records. \n",
    "This would allow agents to access and analyze patient data in real-time, \n",
    "but presents significant challenges related to data interoperability, \n",
    "security, and privacy.\n",
    "* **Explainability:**  Understanding *how* an AI arrived at a conclusion \n",
    "is critical in healthcare. This can be a challenge with complex AI \n",
    "systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence, CrewAI is a framework for building automated workflows using \n",
    "AI agents. It's about breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more \n",
    "manageable components and assigning them to specialized agents.  It's \n",
    "still in its early stages, but it has the potential to streamline certain \n",
    "administrative and research tasks, freeing up medical professionals to \n",
    "focus on patient care.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have any specific areas of medical practice you're thinking about?  \n",
    "I can try to illustrate how CrewAI might be applied to those scenarios.  \n",
    "I'm also happy to address any concerns you have regarding safety, privacy, \n",
    "or ethical considerations."

    "\n",
    "#### Core CrewAI Components\n",
    "The imports at the top of our notebook bring in the essential building blocks for creating multi-agent workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Agent`**: Represents an individual AI agent with a specific role, goal, and backstory. Each agent is specialized for particular tasks (e.g., analyzing vital signs, checking symptoms).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Task`**: Defines specific work to be performed by an agent. Tasks have descriptions, expected outputs, and can depend on other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Crew`**: Orchestrates multiple agents and their tasks. It manages the workflow, ensures tasks are executed in the right order, and handles communication between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Process`**: Defines how tasks are executed - either sequentially (one after another) or hierarchically (with a manager agent coordinating others).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tools for Enhanced Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`CodeInterpreterTool`**: Allows agents to execute Python code, perform calculations, create visualizations, and work with data. This is particularly useful for the Vital Signs Analyzer agent to perform numerical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other available tools**: CrewAI offers many tools like `CSVSearchTool`, `WebSearchTool`, and `DatabaseTool` for different data sources and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`dotenv`**: Securely manages API keys and configuration settings through environment variables. This prevents hardcoding sensitive information directly in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LLM Configuration - The Brain Behind the Agents\n",
    "CrewAI agents require a Large Language Model (LLM) to power their reasoning and decision-making capabilities. The LLM serves as the \"brain\" that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understands task instructions\n",
    "- Processes input data  \n",
    "- Makes decisions about what actions to take\n",
    "- Generates responses and outputs\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Access keys safely** with `os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`** to prevent accidental commits to version control\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures your API keys remain secure while making your code portable across different environments (development, testing, production)."

    "## CrewAI Demo: Personalized Activity Recommendations for eCardiacRehab\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Purpose:** \n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook example demonstrates how a team of specialized AI agents, built with CrewAI, can collaborate to analyze a (simulated) patient profile and generate personalized activity recommendations with a subsequent ethical assessment. This illustrates a potential application of AI to support personalization in eCardiacRehab.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `DataInterpreterAgent` analyzes a patient profile to identify key insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An `ActivityDesignerAgent` uses these insights to suggest rehabilitation activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An `EthicsAndComplianceAgent` evaluates the recommendations from an ethical and responsible perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Note**: \n",
    "This is a conceptual demonstration and does not use real patient data or advanced medical tools."

    "### Why CrewAI for this demonstration?\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of CrewAI for this demonstration is strategic. The eCardiacRehab project is itself a multimodal and interdisciplinary initiative with many stakeholders. CrewAI allows us to mirror this interdisciplinary collaboration model in an AI architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialized Agents**: Instead of a single, monolithic AI (which can be perceived as a \"black box\"), CrewAI allows us to define agents with distinct roles, goals, and backstories. This can be compared to how various professional experts (cardiologist, physiotherapist, psychologist, ethicist) collaborate in healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transparent Process**: By observing the interaction between agents, the AI process becomes potentially more transparent and understandable. One can see how different \"expertise areas\" (simulated by the agents) contribute to the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Making AI Accessible**: Such an agent-based approach can make AI concepts more accessible and less threatening to healthcare personnel and other stakeholders, as it builds on familiar principles of teamwork and shared responsibility. This aligns with eHjerteRehab's goal of modernizing and digitalizing work processes in an understandable way."

This format mimics what might be collected from wearable devices, patient apps, and daily check-ins in a real eCardiacRehab system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Patient Record Fields**\n",
    "Each patient record contains exactly **5 standardized fields**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. `patient_id` (String)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Unique identifier for each patient\n",
    "- **Format**: \"P001\", \"P002\", etc.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Enables tracking and reporting by patient across all agents\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. `avg_resting_hr_last_24h` (Integer)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Average resting heart rate over the last 24 hours\n",
    "- **Units**: Beats per minute (bpm)\n",
    "- **Normal Range**: Typically 60-90 bpm for cardiac patients\n",
    "- **Clinical Significance**: Elevated resting HR (>90 bpm) may indicate:\n",
    "  - Medication issues\n",
    "  - Dehydration\n",
    "  - Stress or anxiety\n",
    "  - Potential cardiac complications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. `max_hr_during_exercise_last_24h` (Integer)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Peak heart rate during any exercise activity in the past 24 hours\n",
    "- **Units**: Beats per minute (bpm)\n",
    "- **Expected Range**: 120-170 bpm depending on exercise intensity and patient condition\n",
    "- **Clinical Significance**: Helps assess exercise tolerance and adherence to prescribed heart rate zones\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. `total_steps_last_24h` (Integer)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Total step count over 24 hours from wearable device\n",
    "- **Units**: Number of steps\n",
    "- **Target Range**: Typically 2000+ steps for cardiac rehabilitation patients\n",
    "- **Clinical Significance**: Low step counts (<2000) may indicate:\n",
    "  - Reduced mobility\n",
    "  - Fatigue\n",
    "  - Fear of exercise\n",
    "  - Potential complications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. `reported_symptoms_text` (String)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Free-text patient-reported symptoms and feelings\n",
    "- **Format**: Natural language descriptions\n",
    "- **Content**: Includes physical symptoms, emotional state, activity completion\n",
    "- **Clinical Significance**: Contains critical keywords that may indicate urgent concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Range Analysis in Our Demo**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patients with Concerning Vital Signs:**\n",
    "- **P002**: High resting HR (95 bpm) AND low steps (1800)\n",
    "- **P004**: Low steps (1500) \n",
    "- **P005**: High resting HR (102 bpm)\n",
    "- **P006**: Very low steps (950)\n",
    "- **P008**: High resting HR (93 bpm)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patients with Concerning Symptoms:**\n",
    "- **P002**: \"chest pain\", \"dizzy\"\n",
    "- **P004**: \"palpitations\", \"dizziness\"\n",
    "- **P006**: \"chest discomfort\"\n",
    "- **P008**: \"severe discomfort\", \"faint\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patients with Normal Profiles:**\n",
    "- **P001**: Normal vitals, positive symptoms\n",
    "- **P003**: Normal vitals, mild fatigue (not critical)\n",
    "- **P007**: Normal vitals, excellent symptoms\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-World Data Source Simulation**\n",
    "In an actual eCardiacRehab system, this data would originate from:\n",
    "- **Wearable devices** (heart rate, steps) - Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin\n",
    "- **Patient mobile apps** (symptom reporting, daily check-ins)\n",
    "- **Electronic health records** (patient identifiers, baseline data)\n",
    "- **Telehealth platforms** (structured questionnaires)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Processing for AI Agents**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "patient_data_summary_str = \"\\n\".join([str(p) for p in patient_data_input])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion to string format:\n",
    "- **Serializes** the structured data for text-based LLM processing\n",
    "- **Maintains** all field information in a readable format\n",
    "- **Enables** the `{patient_data_input_str}` placeholder in task descriptions\n",
    "- **Allows** each agent to access the complete dataset while focusing on their specialized analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scalability Considerations**\n",
    "In a real system, data would come from databases or APIs. This simplified 8-patient dataset demonstrates the concept, but a production eCardiacRehab system would handle:\n",
    "- **Hundreds or thousands** of patients simultaneously\n",
    "- **Historical data** tracking trends over weeks/months\n",
    "- **Additional fields** like medication adherence, sleep quality, weight, blood pressure\n",
    "- **Real-time streaming** data rather than 24-hour summaries\n",
    "- **Integration** with hospital systems and clinical workflows\n",
    "\n",

    "### Agent Structure and Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these three agents follows the CrewAI Agent pattern with several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Vital Signs Analyzer Agent**\n",
    "- **Role**: Acts as a \"Vital Signs Monitoring Specialist\" - this defines the agent's professional identity\n",
    "- **Goal**: Provides specific, measurable criteria for what constitutes concerning readings (HR > 90 bpm, steps < 2000)\n",
    "- **Backstory**: Establishes the agent's expertise context and training focus on cardiac rehabilitation patients\n",
    "- **Function**: This agent will receive numerical health data and apply the defined thresholds to flag potential issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Symptom Checker Agent**\n",
    "- **Role**: Functions as a \"Patient Symptom Screener\" - focused on natural language processing\n",
    "- **Goal**: Defines specific keywords to search for in patient text ('chest pain', 'dizzy', 'palpitations', etc.)\n",
    "- **Backstory**: Emphasizes language understanding and urgent symptom detection capabilities\n",
    "- **Function**: This agent processes free-text patient reports to identify critical symptoms\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Clinical Reporter Agent**\n",

    "- **Goal**: Specifies the output format (Markdown) and structure (patient-by-patient summary)\n",
    "- **Backstory**: Highlights skills in information synthesis and professional healthcare communication\n",
    "- **Function**: This agent takes input from the other two agents and creates a structured report\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `llm=<llm>` Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "The `llm=llm` parameter is crucial - it specifies which Large Language Model each agent will use to process information and generate responses. This parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connects the agent to its \"brain\"** - the actual AI model that will interpret the role, goal, and backstory\n",
    "- **Ensures consistency** - all agents use the same underlying model but with different specialized prompts\n",
    "- **Allows flexibility** - you can assign different models to different agents if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Ollama with Gemma 3 27B (a local LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a local Ollama model like Gemma 3 27B, you would need to configure the `llm` variable before creating the agents. Here's how:\n",

    "## The `tools` Parameter and Code Interpreter Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The commented line `# tools=[code_interpreter_tool]` reveals an important aspect of CrewAI agent capabilities - the ability to equip agents with specialized tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Tools in CrewAI?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools extend an agent's capabilities beyond simple text processing. They allow agents to:\n",
    "- Execute code\n",
    "- Access external APIs\n",
    "- Perform calculations\n",
    "- Read/write files\n",
    "- Search databases\n",
    "- Make web requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Code Interpreter Tool Specifically\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CodeInterpreterTool` would give the agent the ability to:\n",
    "- **Execute Python code dynamically** during task execution\n",
    "- **Perform complex calculations** on vital signs data\n",
    "- **Generate visualizations** of patient trends\n",
    "- **Process data files** (CSV, JSON) containing patient information\n",
    "- **Validate data integrity** and perform statistical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's Commented Out\n",
    "\n",
    "The comment suggests this is optional and depends on whether a `CodeInterpreterTool` has been \"instantiated globally.\" This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# You would first need to create the tool:\n",
    "from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool\n",
    "\n",
    "code_interpreter_tool = CodeInterpreterTool()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Then uncomment and use it in the agent:\n",
    "vital_signs_analyzer = Agent(\n",
    "    # ... other parameters ...\n",
    "    tools=[code_interpreter_tool]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Benefits for Healthcare Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the Vital Signs Analyzer:**\n",
    "- Could calculate statistical measures (mean, std dev) across patient populations\n",
    "- Generate trend analysis over time\n",
    "- Create visualizations of heart rate patterns\n",
    "- Validate data ranges and detect outliers programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use case:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The agent could execute code like:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate rolling average of heart rate\n",
    "hr_data = [85, 92, 88, 95, 101, 87]\n",
    "rolling_avg = np.convolve(hr_data, np.ones(3)/3, mode='valid')\n",
    "flagged = any(hr > 90 for hr in hr_data)\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security and Healthcare Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- More sophisticated data analysis capabilities\n",
    "- Ability to handle complex medical calculations\n",
    "- Dynamic threshold adjustments based on patient history\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks:**\n",
    "- Code execution introduces security concerns\n",
    "- Need to ensure executed code doesn't access unauthorized data\n",
    "- Potential for errors in dynamically generated code\n",
    "- Compliance with healthcare data protection regulations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of general code execution, you might prefer domain-specific tools:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from custom_tools import VitalSignsValidatorTool, MedicalCalculatorTool\n",
    "\n",
    "vital_signs_analyzer = Agent(\n",
    "    # ... other parameters ...\n",
    "    tools=[VitalSignsValidatorTool(), MedicalCalculatorTool()]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides controlled functionality without the security risks of arbitrary code execution, which is often more appropriate for healthcare applications where data security and predictable behavior are paramount."

    "## Task Definitions: Detailed Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a comprehensive explanation of each task, showing how they work together in the CrewAI workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Vital Analysis Task** (`vital_analysis_task`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assigned Agent:** `vital_signs_analyzer` (Vital Signs Monitoring Specialist)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Description Breakdown:**\n",
    "- **Input:** Receives the full patient data summary string via `{patient_data_input_str}` placeholder\n",
    "- **Analysis Criteria:** \n",
    "  - Flag patients with **resting heart rate > 90 bpm** \n",
    "  - Flag patients with **total steps < 2000**\n",
    "  - Uses OR logic (either condition triggers a flag)\n",
    "- **Processing:** Agent systematically reviews each patient's numerical vital signs data\n",
    "- **Output Requirement:** Must list patient ID + specific flagged values, or note \"no flags\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output Format:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Patient P001: No vital signs flagged\n",
    "Patient P002: Flagged - Resting HR: 95 bmp, Total Steps: 1800\n",
    "Patient P003: No vital signs flagged\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Symptom Check Task** (`symptom_check_task`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assigned Agent:** `symptom_checker` (Patient Symptom Screener)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Description Breakdown:**\n",
    "- **Input:** Same patient data, but focuses on `reported_symptoms_text` field\n",
    "- **Keyword Detection:** Searches for critical terms:\n",
    "  - `'chest pain'`\n",
    "  - `'dizzy'` / `'dizziness'`\n",
    "  - `'severe discomfort'`\n",
    "  - `'palpitations'`\n",
    "  - `'faint'`\n",
    "- **Processing:** Agent performs natural language analysis to detect concerning symptom reports\n",
    "- **Output Requirement:** Extract exact flagged symptom text with patient IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output Format:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Patient P001: No critical symptoms reported\n",
    "Patient P002: Flagged symptoms - \"chest pain\" and \"dizzy\"\n",
    "Patient P004: Flagged symptoms - \"palpitations\" and \"dizziness\"\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Reporting Task** (`reporting_task`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assigned Agent:** `clinical_reporter` (Clinical Summary Generator)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Description Breakdown:**\n",
    "- **Input Sources:** Receives outputs from BOTH previous tasks via `context=[vital_analysis_task, symptom_check_task]`\n",
    "- **Synthesis Role:** Combines findings from both analyses into unified patient-by-patient report\n",
    "- **Format Requirement:** Must output **only** Markdown-formatted report\n",
    "- **Structure:** Each patient gets their own section with complete findings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output Format:**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Patient ID: P001\n",
    "- No immediate concerns noted for this patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patient ID: P002  \n",
    "- Flagged Vital Signs: Resting HR: 95 bpm, Total Steps: 1800\n",
    "- Flagged Symptoms: Reported 'chest pain' and 'dizzy'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patient ID: P003\n",
    "- No immediate concerns noted for this patient.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Task Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sequential Dependency**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "context=[vital_analysis_task, symptom_check_task]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `reporting_task` **depends on** the outputs of the first two tasks\n",
    "- CrewAI ensures vital signs and symptom analyses complete **before** report generation starts\n",
    "- This creates a proper data flow: Raw Data → Analysis → Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Template Variables**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"{patient_data_input_str}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This placeholder gets replaced with actual patient data when `crew.kickoff(inputs={...})` is called\n",
    "- Ensures all agents receive the same source data for consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Agent Specialization**\n",
    "Each task is matched to an agent's expertise:\n",
    "- **Numerical analysis** → Vital Signs Analyzer\n",
    "- **Text processing** → Symptom Checker  \n",
    "- **Report generation** → Clinical Reporter\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output Standardization**\n",
    "- Each `expected_output` provides clear formatting examples\n",
    "- Helps the LLM understand exactly what structure to produce\n",
    "- Ensures consistent results across different runs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Execution Order\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1:** `vital_analysis_task` processes numerical thresholds\n",
    "2. **Step 2:** `symptom_check_task` analyzes text for keywords  \n",
    "3. **Step 3:** `reporting_task` synthesizes both analyses into final Markdown report\n",
    "\n",
    "This design demonstrates CrewAI's strength in creating **modular, specialized workflows** where each agent contributes their expertise to a larger collaborative goal - exactly what's needed for complex healthcare data analysis in eHjerteRehab.\n"

    "### **Crew Instantiation** \n",
    "```python\n",
    "ehcardialrehab_crew = Crew(\n",
    "    agents=[vital_signs_analyzer, symptom_checker, clinical_reporter],\n",
    "    tasks=[vital_analysis_task, symptom_check_task, reporting_task],\n",
    "    process=Process.sequential,\n",
    "    verbose=False\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crew Components Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`agents=[]` Parameter**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Defines the team members (AI agents) that will collaborate on the workflow\n",
    "- **Order**: The list order doesn't dictate execution sequence - that's determined by task dependencies\n",
    "- **Composition**: Our three specialized agents:\n",
    "  - `vital_signs_analyzer` - Numerical data analysis specialist\n",
    "  - `symptom_checker` - Text processing and keyword detection expert  \n",
    "  - `clinical_reporter` - Report synthesis and Markdown formatting specialist\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`tasks=[]` Parameter**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Defines the specific work items to be completed by the crew\n",
    "- **Task Assignment**: Each task is pre-assigned to a specific agent via the `agent=` parameter\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: Task execution order is determined by `context=[]` dependencies, not list position\n",
    "- **Workflow**: Our three-step process:\n",
    "  1. `vital_analysis_task` → Analyze numerical thresholds\n",
    "  2. `symptom_check_task` → Process symptom text\n",
    "  3. `reporting_task` → Synthesize findings (depends on first two)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`process=Process.sequential`**\n",
    "- **Execution Model**: Tasks run one after another in dependency order\n",
    "- **Alternative**: `Process.hierarchical` would add a manager agent to coordinate workflow\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Ensures data flows properly from analysis → synthesis → final output\n",
    "- **Synchronization**: Each task completes fully before dependent tasks begin\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`verbose=False`**\n",
    "- **Logging Control**: Determines how much execution detail is displayed\n",
    "- **Options**:\n",
    "  - `verbose=False` → Clean output, shows only final results ✅ (current setting)\n",
    "  - `verbose=True` → Detailed logging showing agent \"thinking\" process, tool usage, and intermediate outputs\n",
    "- **Development Tip**: Use `verbose=True` for debugging and understanding agent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Crew Execution with `kickoff()`**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "results = ehcardialrehab_crew.kickoff(inputs={'patient_data_input_str': patient_data_summary_str})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Starting the Workflow**\n",
    "- **Method**: `kickoff()` is CrewAI's execution trigger that starts the collaborative workflow\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Activates all agents and begins processing the first task in the dependency chain\n",
    "- **Data Flow**: Ensures input data reaches the appropriate tasks through template substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The `inputs={}` Dictionary**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Provides initial data that gets injected into task descriptions\n",
    "- **Template Matching**: The key `'patient_data_input_str'` must exactly match the placeholder `{patient_data_input_str}` used in task descriptions\n",
    "- **Data Injection**: CrewAI replaces all instances of `{patient_data_input_str}` with the actual patient data string\n",
    "- **Consistency**: This ensures all agents receive identical source data for their analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Template Substitution Process**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Before kickoff (in task descriptions):\n",
    "\"Analyze the following patient data summaries:\\n{patient_data_input_str}\\n\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# After kickoff (what agents actually receive):\n",
    "\"Analyze the following patient data summaries:\\n{'patient_id': 'P001', 'avg_resting_hr_last_24h': 72, ...}\\n\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Output: Comprehensive Markdown Report**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Format Characteristics**\n",
    "- **Structure**: Patient-by-patient breakdown with clear headings\n",
    "- **Content**: Combines findings from both vital signs analysis and symptom checking\n",
    "- **Presentation**: Ready-to-display Markdown that can be rendered in notebooks, web apps, or documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Sample Expected Output**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Patient ID: P002\n",

    "## Interpreting the Output and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from this demo crew will be a Markdown-formatted string containing the clinical summary report. It should list each patient from the simulated data, highlighting any flagged vital signs, e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Patient P002: Flagged Vital Signs: Resting HR: 98 bpm, Total Steps: 1800\"\n",
    "\n",
    "and any critical reported symptoms, e.g., \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Patient P002: Flagged Symptoms: Woke up with some chest pain, but it passed. Feeling a bit dizzy today.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients with no flags would be noted as having \"No immediate concerns.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple prototype demonstrates the fundamental capability of CrewAI to orchestrate multiple AI agents to perform a multi-step analysis and reporting task relevant to eHjerteRehab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps for Expansion:\n",
    "This basic prototype can be significantly expanded to move closer to the comprehensive eCardialRehab agent system envisioned:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real Data Integration: \n",
    "\n",
    "Connect agents to actual data sources (databases, APIs for wearables, EHRs) using appropriate crewai_tools (e.g., DatabaseTool, custom API tools) instead of simulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sophisticated Tools: \n",
    "\n",
    "Equip agents with more advanced tools. For instance, the Risk Assessment Agent could use the CodeInterpreterTool to run complex ML models for risk scoring, or a custom tool that queries a medical knowledge graph. The SymptomCheckerAgent could use tools leveraging more advanced NLP models for nuanced symptom understanding rather than simple keyword matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Specialized Agents: \n",
    "Introduce additional agents (e.g., a PersonalizedContentAgent that uses the report from the ClinicalReporterAgent to suggest interventions).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Process**: For more complex patient management scenarios, implement a Process.hierarchical model where a \"ClinicalManagerAgent\" coordinates the other agents, assigns tasks dynamically, and reviews outputs before final action.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robust Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling within agent tasks and tool interactions to manage API failures, data inconsistencies, or unexpected LLM outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Management**: For long-running interactions or more complex patient journeys, incorporate more sophisticated state management to maintain context across multiple crew executions or patient interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration with MLOps** (*set of practices and tools that combine machine learning, software engineering and DevOps principles to automate and streamline the end-to-end lifecycle of ML models, from development and deplayment to monitoring and maintainance*): If agents utilize ML models (e.g., for risk prediction), integrate the system with MLOps pipelines for model versioning, monitoring for performance degradation or data drift, and facilitating retraining cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is critical for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of AI-driven insights in a production healthcare environment. Moving from a Jupyter notebook demonstration to a production-grade eCardialRehab system requires careful consideration of these operational aspects, which are beyond the scope of a simple kickoff() but are essential for the technical manager to plan for in the actual deployment of the eCardialRehab project."

    "\n",
    "**Recap of AI's Transformative Impact on eCardialRehab**\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of Artificial Intelligence holds the promise of fundamentally transforming cardiac eRehabilitation platforms like eCardialRehab. As explored, AI agents, orchestrated by frameworks such as CrewAI, can create a collaborative intelligence layer capable of automating complex monitoring, analysis, and communication tasks. Advanced data analysis, powered by machine learning techniques for pattern recognition in physiological and behavioral data, and natural language processing for understanding patient narratives, can unlock deeper, more nuanced insights into each patient's unique condition and progress. Furthermore, AI-driven communication tools, including intelligent clinician dashboards and personalized patient feedback systems, can make the rehabilitation journey more efficient for clinicians and more engaging and supportive for patients. Collectively, these AI methodologies can shift eCardialRehab from a static content delivery platform to a dynamic, adaptive, and proactive system that offers truly personalized care, enhances patient adherence, and ultimately aims to improve clinical outcomes."

    "## Future Outlook and Recommendations for AI Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey towards a fully AI-integrated eCardialRehab platform should be approached strategically and incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phased Implementation**: It is advisable to begin with foundational AI capabilities. This could involve establishing robust data collection pipelines for wearables and PROs, followed by the development of initial AI agents for data monitoring and basic risk flagging (similar to the prototype). Subsequently, more sophisticated analytical models (ML for predictive risk, NLP for feedback analysis) and more autonomous agent functionalities (e.g., personalized content suggestion, hierarchical task management) can be progressively layered into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ethical Considerations and Data Governance**: Throughout the development and deployment lifecycle, paramount importance must be given to ethical considerations, patient data privacy, and security. Compliance with healthcare data regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) is non-negotiable. Transparent policies regarding data usage and AI decision-making processes should be established.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) as a Core Principle**: Especially for clinical decision support and patient communication involving medical advice, the HITL principle must be embedded. AI should augment, not replace, human clinicians. Mechanisms for clinician review, override, and validation of AI-generated insights or recommendations are crucial for ensuring patient safety and maintaining trust in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Learning and Adaptation**: The field of AI is rapidly evolving. The eHjerteRehab platform should be designed with adaptability in mind, allowing for the integration of new AI techniques, tools, and models as they mature and demonstrate value. This includes establishing processes for ongoing monitoring of AI model performance, retraining as necessary, and gathering feedback from both clinicians and patients to iteratively refine the AI components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focus on Explainability (XAI)**: To foster clinician adoption and trust, efforts should be made to incorporate XAI techniques, particularly for AI components involved in risk assessment or clinical recommendations. Understanding the \"why\" behind an AI's output is critical in healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "By embracing these principles, eCardialRehab can harness the transformative power of AI to deliver a new generation of cardiac eRehabilitation that is more personalized, proactive, efficient, and ultimately, more effective in supporting patients on their journey to recovery and long-term cardiovascular health."

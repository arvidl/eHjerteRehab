## eCardiacRehab

In the project [eCardiacRehab](https://www.helse-bergen.no/en/procard/ecardiacrehab) (eHjerteRehab), a new digital cardiac rehabilitation will be developed and tested for patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention. eCardiacRehab is a digital program that patients with coronary artery disease follow throughout their rehabilitation, at home in their own living room. This is a multimodal and interdisciplinary innovation and research project, with different work packages and many stakeholders involved.
